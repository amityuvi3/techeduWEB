<h1><p style="color:purple">Operators in C / Set 1 (Arithmetic Operators)</h1><hr></p>
</marquee>

<p style="color:red"><b>
 Operators are the foundation of any programming language. Thus the functionality of C language is
 incomplete without the use of operators. Operators allow us to perform different kinds of operations 
 on operands. In C, operators in Can be categorized in following categories:</p></b>
 
  <p style="color:green">
 1. Arithmetic Operators (+ , - , * , / , % , post-increment, pre-increment,post-decrement,
 pre-decrement).<br>
 2. Relational Operators (== , != , > , < , >= & <=) Logical Operators (&&, || and !)<br>
 3. Bitwise Operators (&, |, ^, ~, >> and <<).<br>
 4. Assignment Operators (= , += , -= , *= , etc).<br>
 5. Other Operators (conditional, comma, sizeof, address, redirecton)</p>
 <p style="color:blue"><b>Arithmetic Operators: These are used to perform arithmetic/mathematical
 operations on operands.</b></P>
  <h2>1. Arithmetic Operators:</h2>

 <p style="color:orange">The binary operators falling in this category are:</p>
 <ol type="1">
 <p style="color:indigo"><li>Addition: The ‘+’ operator adds two operands. For example, x+y.</li><br>
 <li>Subtraction: The ‘-‘ operator subtracts two operands. For example, x-y.</li><br>
 <li>Multiplication: The ‘*’ operator multiplies two operands. For example, x*y.</li><br>
 <li>Division: The ‘/’ operator divides the first operand by the second. For example, x/y.</li><br>
 <li>Modulus: The ‘%’ operator returns the remainder when first operand is divided by the second. 
 For example, x%y.</li><br></p>

#include<stdio.h><br>
 
int main()<br>
{<br>
    int a = 10, b = 4, res;<br>
    printf("a is %d and b is %d\n", a, b);<br>
 
    res = a+b; <p style="color:cyan">//addition</p>
    printf("a+b is %d\n", res);
 
    res = a-b;<p style="color:cyan"> //subtract</p>
    printf("a-b is %d\n", res);
 
    res = a*b; <p style="color:cyan">//multiplication</p>
    printf("a*b is %d\n", res);
 
    res = a/b; <p style="color:cyan">//division</p>
    printf("a/b is %d\n", res);
 
    res = a%b; <p style="color:cyan">//modulus</p>
    printf("a%%b is %d\n", res);
 
    return 0;<br>
}<br>
<p style="color:green">
Output:<br>

a is 10 and b is 4<br>
a+b is 14<br>
a-b is 6<br>
a*b is 40<br>
a/b is 2<br>
a%b is 2</p><br>
<h3><p style="color:red">The ones falling into the category of unary arithmetic operators are:</p></h3>
<p style="color:blue">
<ol type="1">
<li>Increment: The ‘++’ operator is used to increment the value of an integer. When placed before the 
variable name (also called pre-increment operator), its value is incremented instantly. 
For example, ++x.<br>
And when it is placed after the variable name (also called post-increment operator), its value is 
preserved temporarily until the execution of this statement and it gets updated before the execution
 of the next statement. For example, x++.</li>

<li>Decrement: The ‘–‘ operator is used to decrement the value of an integer. When placed before the 
variable name (also called pre-decrement operator), its value is decremented instantly.
 For example, –x.<br>
And when it is placed after the variable name (also called post-decrement operator), its value is
 preserved temporarily until the execution of this statement and it gets updated before the execution
 of the next statement. For example, x–.</p></li>
