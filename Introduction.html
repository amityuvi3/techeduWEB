<h1><p style="color:purple">C Language Introduction</h1><hr></p>
</marquee>
<p style="color:darkred">C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973. 
It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write operating system. 
The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, simple set of keywords, 
and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programming like 
operating system or compiler development.Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features
 directly or indirectly from C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript and many other
 languages is mainly based on C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language 
(There are few programs that may compile in C, but not in C++).
</p><br/>
Beginning with C programming:<br/>

<p style="color:indigo">1) Finding a Compiler:
Before we start C programming, we need to have a compiler to compile and run our programs. 
There are certain online compilers like https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/, http://ideone.com/ 
or http://codepad.org/ that can be used to start C without installing a compiler.
</p><br/>
<p style="color:magenta">Windows: There are many compilers available freely for compilation of C programs like Code Blocks 
 and Dev-CPP.   We strongly recommend Code Blocks.</><br>

Linux: For Linux, gcc comes bundled with the linux,  Code Blocks can also be used with Linux.<br>

2) Writing first program:<br>
Following is first program in C<br><br>
<p style="color:blue">
#include <stdio.h><br>
int main(void)<br>
{<br>
    printf("TechEdu");<br>
    return 0;<br>
}</p>
<p style="color:blue">output :TechEdu</p><br>
Let us analyze the program line by line.<br>
<p style="color:red">Line 1: [ #include <stdio.h> ] In a C program, all lines that start with # are processed by preprocessor
 which is a program invoked by the compiler. In a very basic term, preprocessor takes a C program and 
produces another C program. The produced program has no lines starting with #, all such lines are 
processed by the preprocessor. In the above example, preprocessor copies the preprocessed code of stdio.
h to our file. The .h files are called header files in C. These header files generally contain 
declaration of functions. We need stdio.h for the function printf() used in the program.</p><br>

<p style="color:green">Line 2 [ int main(void) ] There must to be starting point from where execution of compiled C program 
begins. In C, the execution typically begins with first line of main(). The void written in brackets
 indicates that the main doesn’t take any parameter (See this for more details). main() can be written 
to take parameters also. We will be covering that in future posts.</p>
<p style="color:purple">The int written before main indicates return type of main(). The value returned by main indicates
 status of program termination. See this post for more details on return type.</p><br>

<p style="color :brown">Line 3 and 6: [ { and } ] In C language, a pair of curly brackets define a scope and mainly used in 
functions and control statements like if, else, loops. All functions must start and end with curly 
brackets.</p><br>
