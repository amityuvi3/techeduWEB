<h2>Pointer</h2>
<p style="color:red">
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the 
memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any
 variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is −</br></br>

type *var-name;</br></br>
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the
 pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication
. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer.</p>
 <p style="color:purple">
Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations −</br>

1.int    *ip;   </br>	
 /* pointer to an integer */</br>
2.double *dp; 	</br>	
   /* pointer to a double */</br>
3.float  *fp; 	</br>	
   /* pointer to a float */</br>
4.char   *ch   	</br>	
  /* pointer to a character */</br>
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is 
the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between
 pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points
 to.</p>

<h3>How to Use Pointers?</h3>
<p style="color:green">
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a)
 We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access
 the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that
 returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following
 example makes use of these operations −</p>
<p style="color:brown"><code>
#include <stdio.h></br>

int main () </br>
{</br>

   int  var = 20;  </br>
    /* actual variable declaration */</br>
   int  *ip;     </br>
    /* pointer variable declaration */</br>

   ip = &var;  </br>
   /* store address of var in pointer variable*/</br>

   printf("Address of var variable: %x\n", &var  );</br>

   /* address stored in pointer variable */</br>
   printf("Address stored in ip variable: %x\n", ip );</br>

   /* access the value using the pointer */
   printf("Value of *ip variable: %d\n", *ip );</br>

   return 0;</br>
}</br>
</code></p>
<p style="color:blue">
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −</br>

Address of var variable: bffd8b3c</br>
Address stored in ip variable: bffd8b3c</br>
Value of *ip variable: 20</p>
<h3>NULL Pointer</h3>
<p style="color:magenta">
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an 
exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is 
assigned NULL is called a null pointer.</br></br>

The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider
 the following program −</p>

<p style="color:violet"><code>
#include <stdio.h></br>

int main ()</br>
 {</br>

   int  *ptr = NULL;</br>

   printf("The value of ptr is : %x\n", ptr  );</br>
 
   return 0;</br>
}</br>
</code></p>
<p style="color:cyan">
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −</br>

The value of ptr is 0</br>
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that 
memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it
 signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention,
 if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.</p></br>
<p style="color:purple">
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows −</br>

if(ptr)     /* succeeds if p is not null */</br>
if(!ptr)    /* succeeds if p is null */</br>
</p>
<h3>Pointers in Detail</h3>
<p style="color:cream">
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following
 important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer −</p>

<p style="color:blue">
Note : Pointers contain addresses. Adding two addresses makes no sense, because there is no idea what 
it would point to. Subtracting two addresses lets you compute the offset between these two addresses.

<b>Write a C program to illustrate Pointer Arithmetic</b>
<p style="color:green"><code>
#include <stdio.h></br>
#include<conio.h> </br>
// Driver program</br>
int main()</br>
{</br>
    // Declare an array</br>
    int v[3] = {10, 100, 200};</br>
 
    // Declare pointer variable</br>
    int *ptr;</br>
 
    // Assign the address of v[0] to ptr</br>
    ptr = v;</br>
 
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)</br>
    {</br>
        printf("Value of *ptr = %d\n", *ptr);</br>
        printf("Value of ptr = %p\n\n", ptr);</br>
 
        // Increment pointer ptr by 1</br>
        ptr++;</br>
    }</br>
}</br>
</code></p>
<p style="color:magenta"></br>
Output:Value of *ptr = 10</br>
Value of ptr = 0x7ffcae30c710</br>

Value of *ptr = 100</br>
Value of ptr = 0x7ffcae30c714</br>

Value of *ptr = 200</br>
Value of ptr = 0x7ffcae30c718</br>
