<h3>
A learning system based on formalised teaching but with the help of electronic resources is known as <br>
E-learning. While teaching can be based in or out of the classrooms, the use of computers and the<br>
 Internet forms the major component of E-learning. E-learning can also be termed as a network enabled <br>
transfer of skills and knowledge, and the delivery of education is made to a large number of recipients <br>
at the same or different times. Earlier, it was not accepted wholeheartedly as it was assumed that this<br>
 system lacked the human element required in learning.<br><br>

However, with the rapid progress in technology and the advancement in learning systems, it is now<br>
 embraced by the masses. The introduction of computers was the basis of this revolution and with the<br>
 passage of time, as we get hooked to smartphones, tablets, etc, these devices now have an importance <br>
place in the classrooms for learning. Books are gradually getting replaced by electronic educational <br/>
materials like optical discs or pen drives. Knowledge can also be shared via the Internet, which is<br>
 accessible 24/7, anywhere, anytime.<br><br><br><br>

Karen's architecture professor walks into the classroom, turns on a slide projector, and proceeds to <br>
flip through images of some of the world's major structures. She's overwhelmed, frantically taking<br>
 notes. She gives up in frustration.<br><br>

Later she learns that all of this information and more is at her fingertips, accessible at any pace she<br>
 chooses, thanks to interactive video programs at the library. She can look at 2,500 images on the <br>
computer screen by selecting lecture numbers from an index.<br>

She can call up text describing each image, call up a notepad, key in the information, and print it<br>
 out to take with her.<br><br>

Robert, a graduate student in civil engineering, receives a job offer in Richmond just prior to</br>
 finishing his master's degree at Virginia Tech. His employer agrees to let him leave work two hours</br>
 early twice a week to complete the last required courses.</br></br>

But how does he get from Richmond to Blacksburg and back to take graduate courses and still have </br>
time to work and study? Via satellite communications.</br></br>

Robert leaves his job at roughly 3 p.m. and arrives at one of 20 designated sites in the state to</br>
 pick up the signal broadcast from an electronic classroom on the Virginia Tech campus.</br></br>

He is able to hold his job, support his two children, and finish his education.</br></br>

Tomorrow's educators </br>
New technologies are increasingly being introduced into education, affecting the learning process</br>
 from elementary curricula to college level programs. In the coming decades, as these technologies </br>
are further developed, many believe that there will emerge a new learning environment that will </br>
require future teachers to shift roles and that will provide more indepth and independent study </br>
for future students.</br></br>

Interactive video systems, for example, will become a commonplace among classrooms from elementary</br>
 grades through college level programs. Students of the future will be able to complete their course</br>
 work on personal computers set up within the classroom, progressing on an individual basis. The</br>
 teacher will oversee their work, assisting them through whatever stage of the program they're at.</br></br>

In fact, two students within one classroom may complete assignments for two separate courses in the</br>
 same subject area—or in two different subject areas. One student may advance to a second-semester </br>
history course, for example, while the other progresses through the first-semester course, within </br>
the same classroom, at the same time.</br></br>

If students are advancing in one subject area—in geography, for example—they may opt to work with a</br>
 program in another subject area—such as foreign language—within the same classroom and at the same</br>
 time.</br></br>

Advances in technology will require tomorrow's educators to interact with students in a more loosely</br> 
structured manner, sometimes over long distances as satellite teleconferencing is increasingly used.</br>
 Teachers will become instructional designers, rather than deliver course content in the one-way</br>
 communication process found in the traditional classroom.</br></br>

"The teachers of the future are going to have to change their mode of thinking to a large extent,"</br>
 says Stanley A. Huffman Jr., director of Distance Learning at Virginia Tech. "Teachers will have to</br>
 reorganize their material, developing small segments. They will have to take the time and effort to</br>
 learn how to put this material into a technology system, whether it be television, interactive video,</br>
 CD-ROM, what have you."</br></br>

Once teachers have designed the course content, gathering information from various resources, they </br>
will work with technical support staff to produce the instructional programs.</br></br>

With the programs in place, teachers should have more time for research, developing new courses, and </br>
meeting with students one-on-one or in small-group tutorial or discussion sessions, according to a </br>
report issued last year by Virginia Tech's University Task Force on the Impact of Digital Technology</br> 
on the Classroom Environment.<br>

The new technologies will also enable students to work outside the classroom, in learning laboratories</br>
 or in their own homes. More flexibility in work schedules for both teachers and students should allow</br>
 for greater productivity, the report states.</br></br>

Interactive video systems, for example, will permit students to proceed with programs at their own pace.</br>
 With such systems, students can also pretest, develop individualized study guides based on a </br>
pretesting error analysis, and test themselves upon completion of the course. The process can be </br>
completed outside the classroom at the student's convenience.</br></br>

"The interactive systems store a lot of information. Students can go backwards, forwards, pick up</br>
 details that they need, react, and interact. They become more active in the learning process," says</br>
 Huffman.</br>

"I think future students will become more engaged in the learning process, with the capacity to <br/>
explore more alternatives, particularly in the areas of computer simulation," says Charles W. Steger,<br/>
 dean of Virginia Tech's College of Architecture and Urban Studies and chair of the university's task<br/>
 force on implementing digital technology. "Rather than just reading about one case study, you could <br/>
sit down and run through several scenarios, which would help to cultivate one's imagination rather<br/>
than give bounds to it."<h3/><br/><br/>
