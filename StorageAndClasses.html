<h1><p style="color:purple">Storage Classes in C</h1><hr></p>
</marquee>

<p style="color:red"><b>Storage Classes are used to describe about the features of a variable/function. 
These features basically include the scope, visibility and life-time which help us to trace the
 existence of a particular variable during the runtime of a program.</p><br></b>

<p style="color:brown"><h3>C language uses 4 storage classes, namely:</h3></p>

<p style="color:green">1. auto: This is the default storage class for all the variables declared inside a 
function or a block. Hence, the keyword auto is rarely used while writing programs in C language. Auto
 variables can be only accessed within the block/function they have been declared and not outside them 
(which defines their scope). Of course, these can be accessed within nested blocks within the parent 
block/function in which the auto variable was declared. However, they can be accessed outside their 
scope as well using the concept of pointers given here by pointing to the very exact memory location
 where the variables resides. They are assigned a garbage value by default whenever they are declared.</p>

<p style="color:magenta">2. extern: Extern storage class simply tells us that the variable is defined
 elsewhere and not within the same block where it is used. Basically, the value is assigned to it in 
a different block and this can be overwritten/changed in a different block as well. So an extern 
variable is nothing but a global variable initialized with a legal value where it is declared in order
 to be used elsewhere. It can be accessed within any function/block. Also, a normal global variable can
 be made extern as well by placing the ‘extern’ keyword before its declaration/definition in any
 function/block. This basically signifies that we are not initializing a new variable but instead we
 are using/accessing the global variable only. The main purpose of using extern variables is that they 
can be accessed between two different files which are part of a large program. For more information on 
how extern variables work, have a look at this link.</p>

<p style="color:indigo">3. static: This storage class is used to declare static variables which are 
popularly used while writing programs in C language. Static variables have a property of preserving 
their value even after they are out of their scope! Hence, static variables preserve the value of their 
last use in their scope. So we can say that they are initialized only once and exist till the 
termination of the program. Thus, no new memory is allocated because they are not re-declared. Their
 scope is local to the function to which they were defined. Global static variables can be accessed 
anywhere in the program. By default, they are assigned the value 0 by the compiler.</p>

<p style="color:blue">4. register: This storage class declares register variables which have the same
 functionality as that of the auto variables. The only difference is that the compiler tries to store 
these variables in the register of the microprocessor if a free register is available. This makes the 
use of register variables to be much faster than that of the variables stored in the memory during the 
runtime of the program. If a free register is not available, these are then stored in the memory only. 
Usually few variables which are to be accessed very frequently in a program are declared with the 
register keyword which improves the running time of the program. An important and interesting point to
 be noted here is that we cannot obtain the address of a register variable using pointers.</p>

<p style="color:red">To specify the storage class for a variable, the following syntax is to be followed:

Syntax:</p>

storage_class var_data_type var_name;<br> 


<p style="color:brown">Functions follow the same syntax as given above for variables. Have a look at the
 following C example for further clarification:</p>

<p style="color:green"> A C program to demonstrate different storage classes</p>

<p style="color:cyan">// declaring and initializing an extern variable</p>

           "of the extern integers 'x' and "

   <p style="color:cyan"> // using a static variable 'y'</p>
    printf("\n'y' is a static variable and its "
           "value is NOT initialized to 5 after"
           " the first iteration! See for"

    printf("\nBye! See you soon. :)\n");<br>
