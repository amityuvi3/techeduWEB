<h1><p style="color:purple">The Control Statement in C</h1><hr></p>
</marquee>

<p style="color:red">
<b>The Control Statement:</b>
Control statements enable us to specify the flow of program control; ie, the order in which the</br> 
instructions in a program must be executed. They make it possible to make decisions, to perform tasks</br>
repeatedly or to jump from one section of code to another.</p>
<p style="color:purple">
There are four types of control statements in C:</p>
<p style="color:grey">
1' Decision making statements</br>
2. Selection statements</br>
3. Iteration statements</br>
4. Jump statements</br>
<p style="color:cream">
<h3>Decision Making Statement:</h3> The if-else Statement
The if-else statement is used to carry out a logical test and then take one of two possible actions</br>
 depending on the outcome of the test (ie, whether the outcome is true or false).</p>
<p style="color:magenta">
Syntax:</br>

if (condition)</br>
{</br>
  statements</br>
}</br>
  else</br>
{</br>
  statements</br>
}</br>
</p>
<p style="color:blue">
If the condition specified in the if statement evaluates to true, the statements inside the if-block</br> 
are executed and then the control gets transferred to the statement immediately after the if-block. </br>
Even if the condition is false and no else-block is present, control gets transferred to the statement</br>
 immediately after the if-block.</p>
<p style="color:green">
The else part is required only if a certain sequence of instructions needs to be executed if the </br>
condition evaluates to false. It is important to note that the condition is always specified in </br>
parentheses and that it is a good practice to enclose the statements in the if block or in the </br>
else-block in braces, whether it is a single statement or a compound statement.</p>
<p style="color:red>
Program checks whether the entered number is positive or negative.</p>
<p style="color:navy"><code>
#include<stdio.h></br>

int main( )</br>

   {</br>

    int a;</br>

    printf("n Enter a number:");</br>

    scanf("%d", &a);</br>

    if(a>0)</br>

     { </br>

      printf( "n The number %d is positive.",a);</br>

     }</br>

    else</br>

     {</br>

      printf("n The number %d is negative.",a);</br>

     }</br>

  return 0;</br>

   }</br>
</code></p>
Output:</br>
 Enter a number 7</br>
 The number 7 is positive</br>

<p style="color:red">
The following pProgram compares two strings to check whether they are equal or not.</p>
<p style="color:cream"><code>
#include <stdio.h>

#include <string.h></br>

int main( )</br>

   {</br>

    char a[20] ,  b[20];</br>

    printf("n Enter the first string:");</br>

    scanf("%s",a);</br>

    printf("n Enter the second string:");</br>

    scanf("%s",b);</br>

    if((strcmp(a,b)==0))</br>

      {</br>

       printf("nStrings are the same");</br>

       }</br>

    else</br>

      {</br>

      printf("nStrings are different");</br>

      }</br>

  return 0;</br>

  }</br>
</code></p>
<p style="color:purple">
The above program compares two strings to check whether they are the same or not. The strcmp function</br>
 is used for this purpose. It is declared in the string.h file as:</p>
<p style="color:green">
int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);</p>
<p style="color:red">
It compares the string pointed to by s1 to the string pointed to by s2. The strcmp function returns an</br>
 integer greater than, equal to, or less than zero,  accordingly as the string pointed to by s1 is </br>
greater than, equal to, or less than the string pointed to by s2.</p>
<p style="color:cyan">
Therefore in the above program, if the two strings a and b are equal , the strcmp function should</br> 
return a 0. If it returns a 0, the strings are the same; else they are different.</p>
<p style="color:blue">
<b>Nested if and if-else Statements</b>
It is also possible to embed or to nest if-else statements one within the other. Nesting is useful in</br>
 situations where one of several different courses of action need to be selected.</p>

The general format of a nested if-else statement is:</br>
<p style="color:magenta"><code>
if(condition1)</br>
{</br>
// statement(s);</br>
}</br>
else if(condition2)</br>
{</br>
//statement(s);</br>
}</br>
.......</br>
.......</br>
......</br>
......</br>
else if (conditionN)</br>
{ </br>
//statement(s);</br>
}</br>
else</br>
{</br>
//statement(s);</br>
}</br>
</code></p>
<p style="color:brown">
The above is also called the if-else ladder. During the execution of a nested if-else statement, as</br> 
soon as a condition is encountered which evaluates to true, the statements associated with that </br>
particular if-block will be executed and the remainder of the nested if-else statements will be </br>
bypassed. If neither of the conditions are true, either the last else-block is executed or if the</br> 
else-block is absent, the control gets transferred to the next instruction present immediately after 
the else-if ladder.</p>
<p style="color:red">
Program makes use of the nested if-else statement to find the greatest of three numbers.</p>
<p style="color:green"><code>
#include<stdio.h>

int main( )</br>
   {</br>
       int a, b,c;</br>
       a=6,b= 5, c=10;</br>
       if(a>b)</br>
          {</br>
             if(b>c)</br>
               {</br>
                 printf("nGreatest is: " , a);</br>
                }</br>
              else if(c>a)</br>
                     {</br>
                      printf("nGreatest is: ", c);</br>
                     }</br>
            }</br>
         else if(b>c)     //outermost if-else block</br>
                {</br>
                 printf("nGreatest is: " , b);</br>
                }</br>
               else</br>
                {</br>
                 printf( "nGreatest is: " , c);</br>
                }</br>
      return 0;</br>
    }</br>
</code></p>
<p style="color:cyan">
The above program compares three integer quantities, and prints the greatest. The first if statement</br>
 compares the values of a and b. If a>b is true, program control gets transferred to the if-else </br>
statement nested inside the if block, where b is compared to c. If  b>c is also true, the value of a</br>
 is printed; else the value of c and a are compared and if c>a is true, the value of c is printed.</br>
 After this the rest of the if-else ladder is bypassed.</p>
<p style="color:navy">
However, if the first condition a>b is false, the control directly gets transferred to the outermost</br> 
else-if block, where the value of b is compared with c (as a is not the greatest). If b>c is true the</br>
 value of b is printed else the value of c is printed. Note the nesting, the use of braces, and the</br>
 indentation. All this is required to maintain clarity.</p>

<h3>2. Selection Statement: </h3>the switch-case Statement</br>
<p style="color:purple">
A switch statement is used for multiple way selections that will branch into different code segments</br>
 based on the value of a variable or expression. This expression or variable must be of integer data 
type.</p>
<p style="color:magenta"><code>
Syntax:</br>

switch (expression)</br>
{</br>
  case value1:</br>
    code segment1;</br>
    break;</br>
  case value2:</br>
    code segment2;</br>
    break;</br>
.....</br>
.....</br>
.....</br>
  case valueN:</br>
    code segmentN;</br>
    break;</br>
  default:</br>
    default code segment;</br>
}</code></p>
<p style="color:cream">
The value of this expression is either generated during program execution or read in as user input.</br>
 The case whose value is the same as that of the expression is selected and executed. The optional </br>
default label is used to specify the code segment to be executed when the value of the expression does </br>
not match with any of the case values.</p>
<p style="color:blue">
The break statement is present at the end of every case. If it were not so, the execution would continue</br>
 on into the code segment of the next case without even checking the case value. For example, supposing</br>
 a switch statement has five cases and the value of the third case matches the value of expression. If</br>
 no break statement were present at the end of the third case, all the cases after case 3 would also get</br>
 executed along with case 3. If break is present only the required case is selected and executed; after</br>
 which the control gets transferred to the next  statement immediately after the switch statement. There</br>
 is no break after defaultbecause after the default case the control will either way get transferred to</br>

 A program to print the day of the week using Switch statement.</p>
<p style="color:cream"><code>
#include<stdio.h></br>

int main( )</br>

    {</br>

     int day;</br>

     printf("nEnter the number of the day:");</br>

     scanf("%d",&day);</br>

     switch(day)</br>
        {</br>
          case 1:</br>
                  printf("Sunday");</br>
                  break;</br>
          case 2:</br>
                  printf("Monday");</br>
                  break;</br>
          case 3:</br>
                  printf("Tuesday");</br>
                  break;</br>
          case 4:</br>
                  printf("Wednesday");</br>
                  break;</br>
          case 5:</br>
                  printf("Thursday");</br>
                  break;</br>
          case 6:</br>
                  printf("Friday");</br>
                  break;</br>
          case 7:</br>
                  printf("Saturday");</br>
                  break;</br>
          default:</br>
                  printf("Invalid choice");</br>
        }</br>
   return 0;</br>

     }</br>
</code></p>
<p style="color:cyan">
This is a very basic program that explains the working of the switch-case construct. Depending upon the</br>
 number entered by the user, the appropriate case is selected and executed. For example, if the user </br>
input is 5, then case 5 will be executed. The break statement present in case 5 will pause execution of</br>
 the switch statement after case 5 and the control will get transferred to the next statement after 
switch, which is:</br>

return 0;</p>
<p style="color:magenta">
It is also possible to embed compound statements inside the case of a switch statement. These compound</br>
 statements may contain control structures. Thus, it is also possible to have a nested switch by </br>
embedding it inside a case.</p>
<p style="color:navy">
All programs written using the switch-case statement can also be written using the if-else statement.</br>
 However, it makes good programming sense to use the if statement when you need to take some action </br>
after evaluating some simple or complex condition which may involve a combination of relational and </br>
logical expressions (eg, (if((a!=0)&&(b>5))).</p>
<p style="color:orange">
If you need to select among a large group of values, a switch statement will run much faster than a set</br>
 of nested ifs. The switch differs from the if in that switch can only test for equality, whereas if</br>
 can evaluate any type of Boolean expression.</p>
<p style="color:brown">
The switch statement must be used when one needs to make a choice from a given set of choices. The </br>
switch case statement is generally used in menu-based applications. The most common use of a switch-case</br>
 statement is in data handling or file processing. Most of file handling involves the common functions: </br>
creating a file, adding records, deleting records, updating records, printing the entire file or some </br>
selective records. The following program gives an idea of how the switch case statement may be used in</br>
 data handling. It does not involve the code for file processing as we can discuss file handling in C </br>
only after we have learnt advanced concepts like pointers, structures and unions.</p></br>

<p style="color:red">
 A switch case statement used in data file processing.</p>
<p style="color:blue"><code>
#include<stdio.h></br>

int main()</br>

    { //create file &set file pointer .</br>

     int choice;</br>

     printf("n Please select from the following options:");</br>

     printf("n 1. Add a record at the end of the file.");</br>

     printf("n 2. Add a record at the beginning of the file:");</br>

     printf("n 3. Add a record after a particular record:";</br>

     printf("nPlease enter your choice:(1/2/3)?");</br>

     scanf("%d",&choice);</br>

     switch(choice)</br>

         {</br>

           case 1:</br>

                   //code to add record at the end of the file</br>

                   break;</br>

           case 2:</br>

                   //code to add record at the beginning of the file</br>

                    break;</br>

           case 3:</br>

                   //code to add record after a particular record</br>

                    break;</br>

           default:</br>

                   printf("n Wrong Choice");</br>

        }</br>

    return 0;</br>

    }</br>

The above example of switch-case generally involves nesting the switch-case construct inside an</br>
 iteration construct like do-while. In our nex post, we will discuss these iteration statements.</p>
