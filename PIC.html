</marquee>

<p style="color:red">
<b>1. What is the difference between Call by Value and Call by Reference?</b> </br> 
When using Call by Value, you are sending the value of a variable as parameter to a function, whereas 
Call by Reference sends the address of the variable. Also, under Call by Value, the value in the 
parameter is not affected by whatever operation that takes place, while in the case of Call by Reference
, values can be affected by the process within the function.</p> </br> 
<p style="color:purple">
<b>2. What is a stack?</b> </br> 
A stack is one form of a data structure. Data is stored in stacks using the FILO (First In Last Out)
 approach. At any particular instance, only the top of the stack is accessible, which means that in 
order to retrieve data that is stored inside the stack, those on the upper part should be extracted 
first. Storing data in a stack is also referred to as a PUSH, while data retrieval is referred to as a
 POP.</p> </br> 
<p style="color:brown">
<b>3. What is a sequential access file?</b> </br> 
When writing programs that will store and retrieve data in a file, it is possible to designate that file
 into different forms. A sequential access file is such that data are saved in sequential order: one 
data is placed into the file after another. To access a particular data within the sequential access
 file, data has to be read one data at a time, until the right one is reached.</p> </br> 
<p style="color:navy">
<b>4. Differentiate Source Codes from Object Codes?</b> </br> 
Source codes are codes that were written by the programmer. It is made up of the commands and other
 English-like keywords that are supposed to instruct the computer what to do. However, computers would 
not be able to understand source codes. Therefore, source codes are compiled using a compiler. The
 resulting outputs are object codes, which are in a format that can be understood by the computer
 processor. In C programming, source codes are saved with the file extension .C, while object codes are
 saved with the file extension .OBJ</p> </br> 
<p style="color:cyan">
<b>5. What is the use of a ‘\0’ character?</b> </br> 
It is referred to as a terminating null character, and is used primarily to show the end of a string 
value.</p> </br> 
 <p style="color:blue">
<b>6. Compare and contrast compilers from interpreters.</b> </br> 
Compilers and interpreters often deal with how program codes are executed. Interpreters execute program
 codes one line at a time, while compilers take the program as a whole and convert it into object code,
 before executing it. The key difference here is that in the case of interpreters, a program may 
encounter syntax errors in the middle of execution, and will stop from there. On the other hand,
 compilers check the syntax of the entire program and will only proceed to execution when no syntax 
errors are found.</p> </br> 
<p style="color:magenta">
<b>7. What are compound statements?</b> </br> 

Compound statements are made up of two or more program statements that are executed together. This 
usually occurs while handling conditions wherein a series of statements are executed when a TRUE or 
FALSE is evaluated. Compound statements can also be executed within a loop. Curly brackets { } are 
placed before and after compound statements.</p> </br> 
<p style="color:violet">
<b>8. How do you generate random numbers in C?</b> </br> 
Random numbers are generated in C using the rand() command. For example: anyNum = rand() will generate
 any integer number beginning from 0, assuming that anyNum is a variable of type integer.</p> </br> 
<p style="color:green">
<b>9. What are logical errors and how does it differ from syntax errors?</b> </br> 

Program that contains logical errors tend to pass the compilation process, but the resulting output may
 not be the expected one. This happens when a wrong formula was inserted into the code, or a wrong 
sequence of commands was performed. Syntax errors, on the other hand, deal with incorrect commands that
 are misspelled or not recognized by the compiler.</p> </br> 
<p style="color:orange">
<b>10. What are the different types of control structures in programming?</b> </br> 
There are 3 main control structures in programming: Sequence, Selection and Repetition. Sequential
 control follows a top to bottom flow in executing a program, such that step 1 is first perform, 
followed by step 2, all the way until the last step is performed. Selection deals with conditional 
statements, which mean codes are executed depending on the evaluation of conditions as being TRUE or 
FALSE. This also means that not all codes may be executed, and there are alternative flows within. 
Repetitions are also known as loop structures, and will repeat one or two program statements set by a
 counter.</p> </br> 

<p style="color:purple">
<b>11. What are preprocessor directives?</b> </br> 
Preprocessor directives are placed at the beginning of every C program. This is where library files are
 specified, which would depend on what functions are to be used in the program. Another use of
 preprocessor directives is the declaration of constants.Preprocessor directives begin with the
 # symbol.</p> </br> 
<p style="color:red">
<b>12. What are the different file extensions involved when programming in C?</b> </br> 
Source codes in C are saved with .C file extension. Header files or library files have the .H file 
extension. Every time a program source code is successfully compiled, it creates an .OBJ object file, 
and an executable .EXE file. </p> </br> 
<p style="color:navy">
<b>13. What are reserved words?</b> </br> 
Reserved words are words that are part of the standard C language library. This means that reserved 
words have special meaning and therefore cannot be used for purposes other than what it is originally 
intended for. Examples of reserved words are int, void, and return.</p> </br> 
<p style="color:brown">
<b>14. What are linked list?</b> </br> 
A linked list is composed of nodes that are connected with another. In C programming, linked lists are
 created using pointers. Using linked lists is one efficient way of utilizing memory for storage.</p></br> 
<p style="color:grey">
<b>15. What is the difference between functions abs() and fabs()?</b> </br> 
These 2 functions basically perform the same action, which is to get the absolute value of the given
 value. Abs() is used for integer values, while fabs() is used for floating type numbers. Also, the
 prototype for abs() is under <stdlib.h>, while fabs() is under <math.h>.</p> </br> 
<p style="color:cyan">
<b>16.What are enumerated types?</b> </br> 
Enumerated types allow the programmer to use more meaningful words as values to a variable. Each item
 in the enumerated type variable is actually associated with a numeric code. For example, one can 
create an enumerated type variable named DAYS whose values are Monday, Tuesday… Sunday. </b> </br> 
<p style="color:magenta">
<b>17.What does the function toupper() do?</b> </br> 

It is used to convert any letter to its upper case mode. Toupper() function prototype is declared in  
<ctype.h>. Note that this function will only convert a single character, and not an entire string.</p> </br> 
<p style="color:navy">
<b>18. Is it possible to have a function as a parameter in another function?</b> </br> 
Yes, that is allowed in C programming. You just need to include the entire function prototype into the
 parameter field of the other function where it is to be used.</p> </br> 
<p style="color:blue">
<b>19. What is the difference between functions getch() and getche()?</b> </br> 
Both functions will accept a character input value from the user. When using getch(), the key that was
 pressed will not appear on the screen, and is automatically captured and assigned to a variable. When 
using getche(), the key that was pressed by the user will appear on the screen, while at the same time
 being assigned to a variable. </p> </br> 
<p style="color:purple">
<b>20. What are structure types in C?</b> </br> 
Structure types are primarily used to store records. A record is made up of related fields. This makes
 it easier to organize a group of related data.</b> </br> 
<p style="color:cyan">
<b>21. What does the characters “r” and “w” mean when writing programs that will make use of files?</b> </br> 
“r” means “read” and will open a file as input wherein data is to be retrieved. “w” means “write”, and 
will open a file for output. Previous data that was stored on that file will be erased.</p> </br> 
<p style="color:orange">
<b>22. What is the difference between text files and binary files?</b> </br> 
Text files contain data that can easily be understood by humans. It includes letters, numbers and other
 characters. On the other hand, binary files contain 1s and 0s that only computers can interpret.</p></br>  
<p style="color:green">
<b>23. What is the advantage of a random access file?</b> </br> 
If the amount of data stored in a file is fairly large, the use of random access will allow you to
 search through it quicker. If it had been a sequential access file, you would have to go through one
 record at a time until you reach the target data. A random access file lets you jump directly to the 
target address where data is located. </b> </br> 
<p style="color:blue">
<b>24. How do you search data in a data file using random access method?</b> </br> 
Use the fseek() function to perform random access input/ouput on a file. After the file was opened by 
the fopen() function, the fseek would require three parameters to work: a file pointer to the file, the
 number of bytes to search, and the point of origin in the file.</p> </br> 

<p style="color:brown">
<b>25. Is there a built-in function in C that can be used for sorting data?</b> </br> 
Yes, use the qsort() function. It is also possible to create user defined functions for sorting, such
 as those based on the balloon sort and bubble sort algorithm.</p> </br>  
<p style="color:navy">
<b>26. What are the advantages and disadvantages of a heap?</b> </br> 
Storing data on the heap is slower than it would take when using the stack. However, the main advantage
 of using the heap is its flexibility. That’s because memory in this structure can be allocated and 
remove in any particular order. Slowness in the heap can be compensated if an algorithm was well 
designed and implemented. </p> </br> 
<p style="color:magenta">
<b>27. How do you convert strings to numbers in C?</b> </br> 
You can write you own functions to do string to number conversions, or instead use C’s built in 
functions. You can use atof to convert to a floating point value, atoi to convert to an integer value, 
and atol to convert to a long integer value.</p> </br> 
<p style="color:purple">
<b>28. What is the use of a semicolon (;) at the end of every program statement?</b> </br> 
It has to do with the parsing process and compilation of the code. A semicolon acts as a delimiter, so 
that the compiler knows where each statement ends, and can proceed to divide the statement into smaller
 elements for syntax checking.</p> </br> 
<p style="color:orange">
<b>29. What are binary trees?</b> </br> 
Binary trees are actually an extension of the concept of linked lists. A binary tree has two pointers,
 a left one and a right one. Each side can further branch to form additional nodes, which each node
 having two pointers as well.</p> </br>
