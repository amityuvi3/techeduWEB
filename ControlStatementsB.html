<h1><p style="color:purple">Control Statement in C (page 2)</h1><hr></p>
</marquee>

<h3> Iteration Statements</h3>
 <p style="color:red">
An iteration statement, or loop, repeatedly executes a statement, known as the loop body, until the 
controlling expression is false (0). The control expression must have a scalar type.</p>
<p style="color:brown">
The while statement evaluates the control expression before executing the loop body .</p>
<p style="color:magenta">
The do statement evaluates the control expression after executing the loop body; at least one execution
 of the loop body is guaranteed .</p>
<p style="color:purple">
The for statement executes the loop body based on the evaluation of the second of three expressions.</p>

<h3>The while Statement</h3>
<p style="color:green">
The while statement evaluates a control expression before each execution of the loop body. If the 
control expression is true (nonzero), the loop body is executed. If the control expression is false
 (0), the while statement terminates. The while statement has the following syntax:</p>
<p style="color:cyan"><code>
while ( expression )</br>

   statement</br>
Consider the following while statement:</br>

n = 0;</br>
while (n < 10)</br>
   {</br>
      a[n] = n;</br>
      n++;</br>
   }</br>
</code></p>
<p style="color:blue">
This statement tests the value of n ; if n is less than 10, it assigns n to the nth element of the
 array a and then increments n . The control expression (in parentheses) is then evaluated; if true 
(nonzero), the loop body is executed again; if false (0), the while statement terminates. If the 
statement n++ were missing from the loop body, this while statement would never terminate. If the 
statement n = 0 were replaced by the statement n = 10 , the control expression is initially false (0),
 and the loop body is never executed.</p>

<h3>The do Statement</h3>
<p style="color:red">
The do statement evaluates the control expression after each execution of the loop body. The do 
statement has the following syntax:</p>
<p style="color:grey"><code>
do</br>
{</br>
   statement</br>
}</br>
   while ( expression ) ;</br>
</p></code>
<p style="color:blue">
The loop body is executed at least once. The control expression is evaluated after each execution of 
the loop body. If the control expression is true (nonzero), the statement is executed again. If the
 control expression is false (0), the do statement terminates.</p>

<h3>The for Statement</h3>
<p style="color:orange">
The for statement evaluates three expressions and executes the loop body until the second controlling
 expression evaluates to false (0). The for statement is useful for executing a loop body a specified 
number of times. The for statement has the following syntax:</p>
<p style="color:brown"><code>
for ( expression-1(opt) ;</br>

   expression-2(opt) ; expression-3(opt))</br>
   statement</br>
The for statement is equivalent to the following code:</br>

expression-1;</br>
while ( expression-2 )</br>

   {</br>
   statement</br>
   expression-3 ;</br>
   }</br>
</p></code>
<p style="color:green">
The for statement executes the loop body zero or more times. Semicolons (;) are used to separate the 
control expressions. A for statement executes the following steps:</p>
<p style="color:purple">
expression-1 is evaluated once before the first iteration of the loop. This expression usually
 specifies the initial values for variables used in the loop.</br>
expression-2 is any scalar expression that determines whether to terminate the loop. expression-2 
is evaluated before each loop iteration. If the expression is true (nonzero), the loop body is executed.
 If the expression is false (0), execution of the for statement terminates.</br>
expression-3 is evaluated after each iteration.</br>
<p style="color:magenta">
The for statement executes until expression-2 is false (0), or until a jump statement, such as break
 or goto , terminates execution of the loop.</p>
Any of the three expressions in a for loop can be omitted:</br>
<p style="color:purple">
If expression-2 is omitted, the test condition is always true; that is, the while loop equivalent 
becomes while(1) . This is an infinite loop. For example:</br>
for (i = 0;  ;i++)</br>
    statement;</br></p>
<p style="color:cyan">
Infinite loops can be terminated with a break , return , or goto statement within the loop body.</br>
<p style="color:blue">
If either expression-1 or expression-3 is omitted from the for statement, the omitted expression is 
evaluated as a void expression and is effectively dropped from the expansion. For example:</br>
n = 1;</br>
for ( ; n < 10; n++)</br>
   func(n);</br>
</p>
In this example, n is initialized before the for statement is executed.</br>

<h2>4. Jump Statements</h2>
<p style="color:red">
Jump statements cause an unconditional jump to another statement elsewhere in the code. They are used
 primarily to interrupt switch statements and loops.</p>
<p style="color:blue">
The jump statements are the goto statement, the continue statement, the break statement, and the return
 statement, which are discussed in the following sections.</p>

<h3>The goto Statement</h3>
<p style="color:green">
The goto statement unconditionally transfers program control to a labeled statement, where the label 
identifier is in the scope of the function containing the goto statement. The labeled statement is the
 next statement executed. The goto statement has the following syntax:</br>

goto identifier;</p>
<p style="color:cyan">
Care must be taken when branching into a block by using the goto statement, because storage is
 allocated for automatic variables declared within a block when the block is activated. When a goto 
statement branches into a block, automatic variables declared in the block are not initialized.</p>

<h3>The continue Statement</h3>
<p style="color:magenta">
The continue statement passes control to the end of the immediately enclosing while , do , or for 
statement. The continue statement has the following syntax:</br>

continue;</p>
<p style="color:purple">
The continue statement is equivalent to a goto statement within an iteration statement that passes 
control to the end of the loop body. For example, the following two loops are equivalent:</p>
<p style="color:blue">
while(1)</br>                           
{  </br>                               
   ....</br>                                  
   ....</br>                                  
   ...</br>                                  
  goto label_1;</br>                    
   ....</br>                                  
   ....</br>                                  
   ...</br>                                 
  label_1:</br>
   ;   </br>                               
 } </br>

while(1)</br>
{  </br>
...
...</br>

continue;</br>
...</br>
...</br>
;</br>
} </br>
 </code></p>
<p style="color:green">                                                            
The continue statement can be used only in loops. A continue inside a switch statement that is inside 
a loop causes continued execution of the enclosing loop after exiting from the body of the switch 
statement.</p>
<h3>The break Statement</h3>
<p style="color:brown">
The break statement terminates execution of the immediately enclosing while , do , for , or switch 
statement. Control passes to the statement following the loop body (or the compound statement of a
 switch statement). The break statement has the following syntax:</br>

break;</p>

<h3>The return Statement</h3>
<p style="color:red">
The return statement terminates execution of a function and returns control to the calling function,
 with or without a return value. A function may contain any number of return statements. The return 
statement has the following syntax:</br>

return expression(opt);</p>
<p style="color:navy">
If present, the expression is evaluated and its value is returned to the calling function. If necessary,
 its value is converted to the declared type of the containing function's return value.</p>

A r<p style="color:cyan">
Return statement with an expression cannot appear in a function whose return type is void .</br>

If there is no expression and the function is not defined as void , the return value is undefined. 
For example, the following main function returns an unpredictable value to the operating system:</br>
</p>
<p style="color:green">
main ( )</br>
  {</br>
   return;</br>
  }</br>

Reaching the closing brace that terminates a function is equivalent to executing a return statement
 without an expression.</p>
