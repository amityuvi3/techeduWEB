<p style="color:red"><b>
We have discussed introduction to operators in C and Arithmetic Operators. In this article, Relational
 and Logical Operators are discussed.</p></b>
<p style="color:green">
<h2>2. Relational operators:</h2>
Relational operators are used for comparison of two values. Let’s see them one by one:</p>
<p style="color:blue">
1. ‘==’ operator checks whether the two given operands are equal or not. If so, it returns true.
  Otherwise it returns false. For example, 5==5 will return true.<br>
2. ‘!=’ operator checks whether the two given operands are equal or not. If not, it returns true.
 Otherwise it returns false. It is the exact boolean complement of the ‘==’ operator. For example,
 5!=5 will return false.<br>
3. ‘>’ operator checks whether the first operand is greater than the second operand. If so, it returns
 true.Otherwise it returns false. For example, 6>5 will return true.<br>
4. ‘<‘ operator checks whether the first operand is lesser than the second operand. If so, it returns 
true. Otherwise it returns false. For example, 6<5 will return false.<br>
5. ‘>=’ operator checks whether the first operand is greater than or equal to the second operand. If so,
 it returns true. Otherwise it returns false. For example, 5>=5 will return true.<br>
6. ‘<=’ operator checks whether the first operand is lesser than or equal to the second operand. If so,
 it returns true. Otherwise it returns false. For example, 5<=5 will also return true.<br>

#include <stdio.h><br>
 
int main()<br>
{<br>
    int a=10, b=4;<br>
    if (a > b)<br>
           printf("a is greater than b\n");<br>
       else printf("a is less than or equal to b\n");<br>
    if (a >= b)<br>
           printf("a is greater than or equal to b\n");<br>
       else printf("a is lesser than b\n");<br>
    if (a < b)<br>
          printf("a is less than b\n");<br>
       else printf("a is greater than or equal to b\n");<br>
    if (a <= b)<br>
          printf("a is lesser than or equal to b\n");<br>
       else printf("a is greater than b\n");<br>
    if (a == b)<br>
          printf("a is equal to b\n");<br>
       else printf("a and b are not equal\n");<br>
    if (a != b)<br>
          printf("a is not equal to b\n");<br>
       else printf("a is equal b\n");<br>
 
    return 0;<br>
}<br>
</p>
<p style="color:magenta">
Output:<br>
a is greater than b<br>
a is greater than or equal to b<br>
a is greater than or equal to b<br>
a is greater than b<br>
a and b are not equal<br>
a is not equal to b
</p><br>

<h2>3. Logical Operators:</h2>
Logical Operators are used to combine two or more conditions/constraints or to complement the evaluation
 of the original condition in consideration. They are described below:</p>
<p style="color:green">
1. Logical AND: The ‘&&’ operator returns true when both the conditions in consideration are satisfied.
 Otherwise it returns false. For example, a && b returns true when both a and b are true 
(i.e. non-zero).<br>
2. Logical OR: The ‘||’ operator returns true when one (or both) of the conditions in consideration is 
satisfied. Otherwise it returns false. For example, a || b returns true if one of a or b is true 
(i.e. non-zero). Of course, it returns true when both a and b are true.<br>
3. Logical NOT: The ‘!’ operator returns true the condition in consideration is not satisfied. 
Otherwise it returns false. For example, !a returns true if a is false, i.e. when a=0.<br>
